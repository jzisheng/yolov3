## Duke Energy Infrastructure - YOLOv3 for xView Dataset
This project gives scripts for transforming the xView Dataset into Darknet format. There are also scripts available for grouping together labels, as noted in [] to prune any invalid or out of bounds labels.

Also provided in this github repository is a utility to split train/test dataset to distribute labels evenly.

### Setup and Installing

Recommended to download pretrained weights from ultralytics. Simply run ",py" and point where xView is stored on your disk.
